** PyANN
** Generic Artificial Neural Network Framework in Python

This is a general framework for creating neural nets, through the use of script files and case files.

Script files define the neural net you want to create. A case file contains optional training and testing data.

Documentation is non-existent, so take a look at the examples in the annlib/scripts and annlib/cases folders.
